# ScreenTracker
A tool that tracks your screentime, with notifications. Currently out for testing.

NOTE: This tool is currently out for current use, however if they are any bugs please notify and I'll be sure to push out a new release. This tool only works on Windows 10. Due to being one of the main libraries only works for windows 10 users. We may have to update when Windows 11 releases.
